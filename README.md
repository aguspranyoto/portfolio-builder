## üìù How to Use

The application is designed to be intuitive. The screen is split into two main sections: the Editor on the left and the Preview on the right.

### Fill in the Form:

- **Images**: Click "Browse" or drag and drop an image file onto the "Background Image" and "Profile Image" cards to upload your pictures.
- **Profile**: Fill in your Name, Title/Position, and a short Description in the "Profile" card.
- **Experience**: The form starts with one experience card. Fill in all the required fields. You can add more experiences (up to 10) by clicking the "+ Tambah Portofolio" button.

### See the Live Preview:

As you type or upload images, the "Preview" panel on the right will update instantly to show you exactly how your final portfolio will look.

### Save Your Changes:

1. When you are ready to save, click the "Simpan Perubahan" button at the top of the editor.
2. The application will validate all your inputs based on the defined rules (e.g., all profile fields and the first experience are required).
3. If there are any errors, an error message will appear under the corresponding field, and a toast notification will alert you.
4. If everything is valid, you will see a success notification, and your data will be saved.

### Persistent Data:

- You can safely close the browser tab or refresh the page.
- When you reopen the application, all your previously saved data will be automatically loaded into both the editor form and the preview panel.

## üìä Data Schema

The application state is managed by Zustand and persisted in the browser's IndexedDB. This allows for storing larger data like image files, which would exceed localStorage limits.

The main data structure is as follows:

```javascript
{
  portfolio: {
    profile: {
      name: "string",
      job_title: "string",
      job_description: "string"
    },
    images: {
      // The image is validated as a File object locally,
      // then converted to a Base64 string for rendering and storage.
      background_image: "string | null",
      profile_image: "string | null"
    },
    experiences: [
      {
        id: "string", // Unique ID for each experience
        position: "string",
        company: "string",
        description: "string",
        start_date: "string", // e.g., "2025-07-17"
        end_date: "string"
      }
      // ... up to 10 experiences
    ]
  }
}
```

## üé® Design Changes & Rationale

While the core layout is based on the provided Figma design, several enhancements were made to improve the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).

- **Focus Mode Dialog**: An "open fullscreen" icon was added to each editor card. Clicking it opens the card in a dialog window, allowing the user to edit a specific section without distractions. This is particularly useful on smaller screens.

- **Confirmation for Deletion**: A confirmation popover was added to the delete buttons for images and experiences. This prevents accidental data loss and provides a better UX.

- **Clearer Error Feedback**: In addition to toast notifications, validation error messages are now displayed directly under each invalid input field, making it easy for users to identify and fix issues.

- **Improved Date Input**: A custom date picker component was implemented to provide a more user-friendly way to select start and end dates for work experiences.

- **General UI Polish**: Minor adjustments to spacing, font weights, and colors were made to enhance visual hierarchy and overall aesthetic appeal.
